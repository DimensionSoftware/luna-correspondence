( Reason 1 )
Revolutionary.  Luna is a revolutionary new tool used to anonymously transmit and receive data securely across the internet.
It's based on finite improbabilities and exploits properties of IP to accomplish its goals.

( Reason 2 )
Mysterious awe factor.  The audience will gaze, in awe, at the various conceptual (Luna's future plans) and 
completed (Luna's current capabilities) ideas illustrated in this presentation and live interactive demo.

( Reason 3 )
World wide security.  The nature of Luna lends itself to possible abuse by terrorists
and other malicious causes.  Chung's Donut Shop hereby presents the information in hopes
that a resolution is developed to invalidate or limit the scope to which Luna is applicable.
If we didn't develop it, someone else--potentially evil and malicious--would.  Therefore, as
a good natured group of people, it's better that the information is released first though us.
