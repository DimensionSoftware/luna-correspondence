	---------
Since no garbage collection system is available, everyone must play nice, coding responsibly
by destroying their objects when finished and making sure not to dispose of active objects.
Most importantly, think before typing -- it will save thought in the long haul.


	On Coding Style
	---------
Please preserve the NeXTish conventions to maintain proper code posterity. 
Refer to the following document if unsure what the above contract is asking:
