	1. Requirements
	---------
These tools are necessary for Luna to successfully compile:
Standard GNU tools <http://www.gnu.org/>
Libpcap <http://www.tcpdump.org/>


	2. Building
	---------
After ensuring the aforementioned requirements are properly installed, do the following:
foo$ make
foo$ ./luna


*** Following are instructions for a manual configuration of Luna.  Please re-build luna or run ./configure.pl for the automatic configuration.

	3. Users
	---------
Finally, at least one user file must be created.  Place the files in the './users' directory with file names
to match the intended user name.  Following is an example for the included (assumed) user, 'default' (./users/default):
---- BEGIN FILE ----
# Protocol Plugin
packet-blasting

# Encoding Plugin
blowfish

# Random Seed
1234567890

# Generate This Many Random Numbers
1000

# Relay hosts below
hostname.net
hostname.com
---- SNIP ----


	Testing
	---------
Luna has been tested to build on the following operating systems/architectures:
Apple's OSX/PowerPC
FreeBSD/x86
Linux/x86

Please aware us of any successful builds from other architectures.
